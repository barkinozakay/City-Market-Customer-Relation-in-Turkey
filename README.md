# City-Market-Customer-Relation-in-Turkey

First, you have to have a solution stack. I suggest you to download "ampps" (https://www.ampps.com/). After installing ampps, you need to download this code and move it to the "ampps install directory"/www/. (for ex: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ampps\www"). 

And now you need to start ampps, and from apache settings you need to edit that notepad file like this.

Then open your browser and type "localhost:8081/" to the search bar and you can see that this folder that you moved it into the ampps/www directory is ready to use.

Open that folder and click on "install.php" and wait for the results.

Here we have some basic project specialities;
- All districts and cities of Turkey should be held in an csv file and imported to the appropriate tables
with install action.
- 500 random Turkish Names and 500 random Turkish Surnames are to be held in an csv file and their
combinations of 1620 full names should be inserted into CUSTOMER table. 1215 full names should
be inserted in the SALESMAN table
- 200 randomly chosen product names that will be inserted to the PRODUCT table.
- 10 different markets.
- Every city should have 5 different randomly chosen markets.
- Every customer should have at most 5 sale item inserted with install action.
- Every market should have exactly 3 salesman who work there.
